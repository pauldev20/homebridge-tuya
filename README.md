# homebridge-tuya

üè† Offical Homebridge plugin for [TuyAPI](https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi).

## Installation

```
npm i homebridge-tuya -g
```

## Basic config.json

The `type` option can be used to indicate the device is a dimmer. It can be set to "dimmer" or "generic", if omitted it will default to generic.

```javascript
{
  "platform": "TuyaPlatform",
  "name": "TuyaPlatform",
  "devices": [
    {
      "name": "Tuya Outlet Device 1",
      "id": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "key": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    },
    {
      "name": "Tuya Dimmer Switch Device 2",
      "id": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "key": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "type": "dimmer"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each `device` object passed to the `devices` array has these properties:
- `name`: the name that should appear in HomeKit.
- `id`: the ID of the device. See [this guide](https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi/blob/master/docs/SETUP.md) for finding the `id` and `key`.
- `key`: the key of the device. See above guide.
- `ip`: IP of device. Usually not necessary, add it if you have issues.
- `type`: the type of device. Currently supported device types:
  - `generic`: default type. A device that has a single, boolean property (such as outlets, light switches, etc). Options (used in the `options` property):
    - `dps`: property index to control.
  - `dimmer`: a device that has an on/off value and a brightness value, such as light switches with dimmers and lightbulbs. Options (used in the `options` property):
    - `dpsOn`: property index to use for on/off commands (defaults to 1).
    - `dpsBright`: property index to use for brightness control (defaults to 2).
    - `minVal`: minimum brightness value (defaults to 11).
    - `maxVal`: maximum brightness value (defaults to 244).

[Options for known devices](https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi/wiki/Device-Details).

## Advanced

For devices with more than one switch (for example, powerstrips), a config would look like this:

```javascript
"devices": [
  {
    "name": "Power strip main",
    "id": "power-strip-id",
    "key": "power-strip-key",
    "options": {      
      "dps": 1
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "Power strip USB",
    "id": "same-power-strip-id",
    "key": "same-power-strip-key",
    "options": {      
      "dps": 2
    }
  }
]
```

Dimmer device example:

```javascript
"devices": [
  {
    "name": "Tuya Dimmer Switch Device",
    "id": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "key": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "type": "dimmer",
    "options": {      // Any or all of 'options' can be omitted
      "dpsOn": 2,     // Defaults to 1
      "dpsBright": 3, // Defaults to 2
      "minVal": 0,    // Defaults to 11
      "maxVal": 100   // Defaults to 244
    }
  }
]
```
